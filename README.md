# My Personal Project: Expense Recording App

### An App that can Help Track User's Income and Outcome.

**What** does the application do?
- The app keeps track of the user's income and spending on various things.
- This app can display the details of income and expenditure *each month*.
- This app can display a form of the statistics of the user's income and expenditure *in different months*.

**Who** will use it?
- People who cannot remember how much money they spent.
- People who do not want to go over budget.
- People who want to know their income and expenditure over a period of time.

**Why** am I interest in this project?

Since I began to study abroad, I need to manage my expenditure and income by myself. I realized that sometimes it is really hard to remember how much money I spend and unexpectedly spend more than my budget. Designing such an app can help me track my *income and outcome* more easily, and adjust my spending habits by referring to the *statistics* generated in the app.

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to set a budget for outcome and check how much money is left in my budget.
- As a user, I want to be able to add an income or outcome transfer to the income or outcome list.
- As a user, I want to be able to delete a transfer from the transfer list.
- As a user, I want to be able to view the income and outcome list.
- As a user, I want to be able to save my transfer lists and budget to file.
- As a user, I want to be able to be able to load my transfer lists and budget from file.

### Phase 4: Task 3
For the Graphic User Interface of my application, when I want to go from the homepage to the transfer list page, new window is popped up. If I have more time, I would make all the pages in one window so user will only look at one page at a time.

Besides, at this time my application uses the same GUI for both income transfer list and outcome transfer list, which means the GUI layout are exactly the same for both of the transfer list. In the future I would create two other GUIs for income and outcome page that extend the current TransferListGUI so that I can modify the layout of one of the list without changing the other one.
